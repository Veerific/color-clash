## Desc
Color Clash is a top-down 2d game where you play as a wizard that has mastery over three elements: earth, fire, and water. Other wizards covet your title and are challenging you to a duel. Prove to them that you are deserving of the title with your skills and wit.

## The Game + Rules

As a player, you have access to three elements: namely earth, fire, and water. You can switch between these elements with **Q** and **E**. Enemies will spawn off screen and come after you, each with an element specialization. This specialization comes with a weakness, creating a rock-paper-sicssor system (Fire > Water > Earth). Use this to your advantage as you clear the hordes of enemies coming your way. 

Defeated enemies reward you with a type of elemental mana. This mana can be used to cast bigger spells that combine the basic elements. These spells can be triggered with (Control scheme). 

In this version of the game, there is one boss available. This is currently broken and will be fixed in future updates
